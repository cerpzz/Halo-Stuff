<p>The first three Halo games—Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3—follow the story of Master Chief, a super-soldier who battles alien enemies called the Covenant and a dangerous parasite known as the Flood. <br> <br>
  In Halo: Combat Evolved, Master Chief and his AI companion, Cortana, are sent to stop the Covenant, who are trying to find a mysterious ring-shaped structure called Halo. The Halo ring has incredible power, and the Covenant believes it can help them win the war. However, Master Chief discovers that the ring is actually a weapon built by an ancient race to destroy the Flood, a deadly parasite that threatens all life. Master Chief’s mission is to stop the Covenant and prevent the Flood from spreading.<br><br>
  Halo 2 takes the story further, introducing new gameplay mechanics like dual-wielding weapons, where players can carry two guns at once. This game also dives deeper into the politics of the Covenant, showing that not all of their factions agree on how to fight the war. Master Chief continues to battle the Covenant while trying to stop them from activating another Halo ring. The game also switches perspectives, letting players control the Arbiter, a Covenant Elite warrior who has his own story and struggles with loyalty.<br><br>
  Finally, in Halo 3, the trilogy reaches its conclusion. Master Chief and his allies launch a final assault to stop the Covenant and the Flood from destroying Earth. The game’s big climax is a battle to save humanity and stop the activation of the Halo rings, which would wipe out all life in the galaxy. With this final fight, Master Chief brings an end to the Covenant war and the threat of the Flood.</p>
